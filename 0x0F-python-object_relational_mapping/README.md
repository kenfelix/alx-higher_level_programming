# ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

**In this project, we linked two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!**

_In the first part, we used the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, we used the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, our biggest concern was “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”. We don’t write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, our code wasn't “storage type” dependent. We can change our storage easily without re-writing our entire project._
